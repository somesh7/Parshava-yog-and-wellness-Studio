        <h3 className='pranic_Ben'> What is Pranic Healing? </h3>
<p>Pranic Healing is a highly developed and tested system of energy treatment that uses prana to balance, harmonize and transform the body’s energy processes. Prana is the Sanskrit word that means life-force. This invisible bio-energy or vital energy keeps the body alive and maintains good health. In acupuncture, the Chinese refer to this energy as Chi. In Japanese it is called Ki, as in Reiki.</p>
<p>Pranic Healing is a simple, yet powerful and effective system of non-touch energy healing. It is based on the fundamental principle that the body is a self-healing entity that possesses the innate ability to heal itself. Pranic Healing works on the understanding that the healing process is accelerated by increasing the life force or vital energy to the affected part of the body.</p>
<p>Pranic Healing is applied on the bio- electromagnetic field known as the aura, or energy body, which is a mold or blue print that surrounds and interpenetrates the physical body. It is in the aura, or energy body, that physical ailments first appear as energetic disruptions, before manifesting themselves as problems in the physical body.</p>
