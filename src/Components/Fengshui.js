        What is FengShui?
      </h4>
      <p>
        By definition, feng shui is a practice of arranging the pieces in living spaces to create balance with the natural world. This is what it means to feng shui your home. The goal is to harness energy forces and establish harmony between an individual and their environment.

        In Asian culture, this philosophy is called the Tao, which translates to mean “the way." Taoism is the way of nature, and all the basic rules of feng shui reflect nature. Here's a look at the essential principles of feng shui: the commanding position, the bagua, and the five elements.

        The Commanding Position
      </h4>
      <p>
        If you'd like to feng shui your home, first you need to know about the commanding position. In feng shui, the commanding position is the spot in a room that is the farthest from the door and not in direct line with it. It puts you diagonal to the door. And ideally, you should have a clear line of sight to the door. The commanding position is where you want to spend most of your time in a room.

        Some of the basic rules of feng shui suggest you determine this dominant position in the room and then place your bed, your desk, or your stove in diagonal alignment if possible. These three parts of your house are critical because each represents an essential part of your life. The bed stands for you, the desk is an extension of your career, and the stove represents your wealth and nourishment.

      <h4 className='feng_def'> The Feng Shui Bagua Map</h4>
      <p>
        <b>  A bagua</b> is the feng shui energy map superimposed on the floor plan of your home. The Chinese word "bagua" translates to mean “eight areas.” Each of the eight areas relates to a different life circumstance, such as family, wealth, or career. And each of these areas has corresponding shapes, colors, seasons, number, and earthly elements. At the center of the bagua—a ninth area—is you, representing your overall wellness.
